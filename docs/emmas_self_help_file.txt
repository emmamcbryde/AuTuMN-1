to get things started for autumn covid, have the following programs on your computer

conemu -useful for using all sorts of bash, cmd and gitbash type environments
anaconda3 -make sure it is on the system path. this is crucial
anaconda prompt, should come with the anaconda3 package
open anaconda promtp -after installing anaconda3, you get this from the program file dropdown, or from a quick search/(or powershell etc if this is easier for you) use python to load all of the requirements by

navigating to the file AuTuMN
pip install -r requirements.txt
otherwise this can be done one by one in the spyder console

open anaconda navigator
set up an environment in the environment tab, and give it a name; I called mine autmnenv
launch spyder
set folder to AuTuMN\apps
open  "run_pycharm.py"
within file "run_pycharm.py" there is a choice of models to run
uncomment the one you want to run and run the file

go to AuTuMN/data to find your outputs ***

when wanting to modify parameters for the scenarios:
the hierarchy starts with AuTuMN/apps/COVID-19/params/base.yml
this can be overwritten for each country inside the file ~/params/[country name]
default is the baseline scenario then they are named scenario1, 2, 3 etc.

when you run_pycharm.py, it points to the base.yml then is overwritten by country default (for country baseline) then the scenarios one by one.

to conduct uncertainty runs there is another.py file
AuTuMN/apps/process_mcmc_outputs.py, which I don't know how to run yet




*** output is found in  AuTuMN/data 

these can be viewed directly as jpeg files but you can also see them in streamlit

open a powershell (using conemu)
write conda activate autmnenv  (for james this is conda activate summer (he must have called the environment by this name)

navigate to directory AuTuMN
enter
streamlit run plots.py (this sits at AuTuMN/plots.py)
